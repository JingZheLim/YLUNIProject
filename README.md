# YLUNIProject
Yaline and Lucas' Year 1 OOP Project

# Project Description
Our first ever C++ project in university, vital in introducing and appling the applications of Object Oriented Programming, as well as the fundemental concepts in project planning, software development and utilising UML diagrams. Although there is a game breaking bug where if you input a value that is different from the expected values, it would go into an infinite loop, I enjoyed working with my group member, to plan and create this project. The game allows for players to engage in strategic turn based battles while progressing through an immersive storyline, and save their progress locally. When players want to come back to their save, players can do so seamlessly in the main menu.
